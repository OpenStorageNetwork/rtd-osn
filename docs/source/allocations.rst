Allocations
===========

Storage on the OSN is allocated in standalone buckets independent of HPC allocations.
There is a one-to-one mapping between buckets and allocations. This User Guide uses
"Allocation" when referring to outward-facing operations such as Allocation requests,
and "Bucket" when referring to inward-facing operations such as Bucket creation.

OSN storage is allocated from the resources at the location(s) closest to the requestor
with capacity to fulfill the request. Allocations of a minimum 10 terabytes and max of
50 terabytes supporting up to 1.6 million files can be requested through the XRAS process.
Larger allocations can be accommodated with additional review.
If your project needs more than more than 50 terabytes or more than 1.6 million files,
please contact the OSN team directly to discuss before you submit your request.

An active research dataset can remain in OSN storage up to five years.
