Welcome to OSN's documentation!
===================================

The Open Storage Network (OSN) is a distributed data sharing and transfer service 
intended to facilitate exchanges of active scientific data sets between research
organizations, communities and projects, providing easy access and high bandwidth
delivery of large data sets to researchers.

The OSN serves two principal purposes: (1) enable the smooth flow of large data sets 
between resources such as instruments, campus data centers, national supercomputing
centers, and cloud providers; and (2) facilitate access to long tail data sets by the
scientific community. Examples of data currently available on the OSN include synthetic
data from ocean models; the widely used Extracted Features Set from the 
`Hathi Trust Digital Library <https://www.hathitrust.org/>`_;
open access earth sciences data from 
`Pangeo <https://pangeo.io/>`_; and Geophysical Data from `BCO-DMO <https://www.bco-dmo.org/>`_.
These data sets are being used by researchers to machine learning models, validate 
simulations, and perform statistical analysis of live data.
