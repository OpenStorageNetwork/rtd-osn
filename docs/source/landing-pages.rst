Landing Pages
=============
Coming Soon!
The data set owner may also create a landing page that follows DOI landing page conventions, 
making it easy to visit from a browser or data catalog.
The landing page contains metadata that describes the data set and links to preconfigured,
downloadable tools for accessing the data set.
OSN provides tools to create a Basic landing page that may be overridden by more sophisticated
landing pages depending upon the needs of the End User community.
The landing page has the following generic template.
